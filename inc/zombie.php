      and the only rule is: only the fittest survive.</p>

    <p>Some will die. Some will <strong>un</strong>die. But luckily for you,
      the Zappos Zombie Zurvival Guide is here to give you three vital tips
      that just might mean the difference between life, death, and undeath.</p>

    <p>So what are you waiting for? Time is ticking! This is Z-Hour, my friend.

  <p>No fuel means no energy, and you'll need all the energy you can get
    if you want to outpace the shambling zombie hordes. First things first:
    stock up on supplies!</p>

  <p>Head over to the closest supermarket or gas station (better hurry
    before all the other survivors clear the shelves!). Grab all the food and
    drinks that you can get your hands on: chips, cookies, water, Red Bull,
    whatever. Now is not the time to worry about calories or high fructose
    corn syrup. Also, make sure to pick up batteries, flashlights, shotgun
    shells, etc. Standard survival supplies. Grab what you can, get into your car, and hit the gas!</p>

  <h1>Aim for the Brain</h1>

  <p>If there's one thing you should have learned from watching <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>,
    it's that a zombie's weak point is its brain. Got a shotgun? Good! I hope you have
    good aim. Gunless? Well, then, you'll just have to improvise.</p>

  <p>Wherever you go, make sure you've got a nice, heavy, blunt instrument with you.
    A baseball bat (or a cricket bat, for all our friends across the Atlantic) features
    a comfortable grip and a nice heft. Even something like a golf club or a rolling pin
    will do. Anything you can decapitate with.</p>

  <h1>When in Doubt, RUN</h1>

  <p>Fortune favors the bold, but you know what? Sometimes, flight is wiser than fight.
    When in doubt, get the heck out! Zombies may be slow, but don't let their snail-paced
    shuffling get you to let down your guard. The undead are <strong>deadly</strong> in groups.
    Don't let yourself get outnumbered, and <strong>do not</strong> let yourself get cornered.
    And never forget: when in doubt, <strong>RUN.</strong></p>

  <p>One more tip: since you're going to be running around a lot, you might want to invest
    in a good pair of <a href="http://www.zappos.com">new shoes</a>.</p>

  <h1>End</h1>

  <p>Well, that's it! Three vital tips to help you survive the zombie apocalypse.
    It won't be easy. It won't be clean. But with some luck, a stock of supplies, a baseball bat,
    and a good pair of shoes, you just might survive the zombie uprising.</p>

  <p class="last"><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
