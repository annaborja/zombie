    <p>So, it's begun. The dawn of the undead has come at last.</p>

    <p>Some will die. Some will <strong>un</strong>die. But luckily for you,
      the Zappos Zombie Zurvival Guide is here to offer three vital tips
      that just might mean the difference between life, death, and undeath.</p>

    <p>So what are you waiting for? Time is ticking! This is Z-Hour, my friend.
      Zero Hour. <strong>Zombie Hour.</strong></p>

  <p>No fuel means no energy, and you'll need all the energy you can get
    if you want to outpace the shambling zombie hordes.</p>

  <p>Head to the nearest supermarket or gas station (better hurry before
    all the other looters clear the shelves!). Gather up all the food and drinks
    that you can get your hands on: bread, chips, water, Red Bull, whatever.
    Now is not the time to worry about calories or high fructose corn syrup.
    Also, make sure to pick up batteries, flashlights, first aid kits, shotgun
    shells, etc. Standard survival supplies. Grab what you can, get into your car,
    and hit the gas!</p>

  <h1>Aim for the Brain</h1>

  <p>If there's one thing you should have learned from watching <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>,
    it's that a zombie's weak point is its brain. Got a shotgun? Good! I hope you have
    good aim. Gun-less? Well, then you'll just have to improvise.</p>

  <p>Wherever you go, make sure you've got a nice, heavy, blunt instrument with you.
    A baseball bat (or a cricket bat, for our friends across the Atlantic) features
    a comfortable grip and good heft. Even something like a golf club or a rolling pin
    will do. Anything you can bludgeon with.</p>

  <p>Fortune favors the bold, but sometimes, flight is wiser than fight.
    When in doubt, get out! Zombies may be slow, but don't let their snail-paced
    shuffling lull you into a false sense of security. The undead are deadly in groups.
    Don't let yourself get outnumbered. Don't let yourself get cornered. And above all:
    when in doubt, <strong>RUN AWAY.</strong></p>

  <p>Also, since you're going to be running around quite a bit, you might want to invest
    in a sturdy new pair of <a href="http://www.zappos.com">shoes</a>.</p>

  <h1>End</h1>

  <p>Well, that's it! Three tips to help you survive the zombie apocalypse.  It won't
    be easy. It won't be clean. But with some determination, a stock of supplies, a
    baseball bat, and a good pair of shoes, you just might survive the undead uprising.</p>

  <p class="last"><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
