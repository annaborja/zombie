  <p>In designing this zoo, there are two main goals to keep in mind: <strong>keeping the
    dragons safe and healthy</strong> and <strong>keeping the customers safe and happy</strong>.</p>

  <p>The dragons must be viewable. However, for the customers' safety, the creatures' habitat
    must be restricted. This suggests two options: <strong>a barred cage</strong> or <strong>a
    glass enclosure</strong>. Steel bars would significantly obstruct the customers' view. Glass,
    therefore, is the preferable choice. For safety, it would have to be the toughest glass
    available, like gorilla glass. Except for dragons.</p>

  <p>To remain healthy and content, dragons need space in which to fly and grow. It would be too
    risky to let the dragons out of their enclosure to fly around, though, because they could then
    escape and burn things and wreak havoc and stuff. The dragon habitat, therefore, needs to be
    <strong>big</strong>. The zoo should ask a dragon expert to estimate the optimal habitat size for
    two or more dragons, keeping in mind whether the zoo plans on breeding the dragons or adding more
    dragons in the future. The roof of the enclosure should be domed so as to maximize space.</p>
