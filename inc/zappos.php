  <p>What excites me about Zappos is its famously unique company culture. In anticipation of graduating
    college next year, I've been researching a lot of companies lately, trying to find good places to
    start my career. Time and time again, I've seen Zappos listed on various "Best Places to
    Work" lists, and I've read reviews written by employees on sites like Glassdoor.com and Quora praising
    the company's familial, fun work environment. I've read the Ten Core Values listed on Zappos.com, and
    I admire the company's genuine dedication to both customer service and employee satisfaction. That
    kind of unselfish integrity is all too rare in the business world.</p>

  <p>What excites me about Zappos.Code() is the chance it offers aspiring developers
    to learn new technologies and improve their skills. Someone like me could definitely
    benefit from an opportunity like this. I'm a self-taught programmer. I didn't discover programming
    until last summer, after my freshman year of college, when I picked up an old PHP book that I had bought
    when I was 13 years old and trying to create a Green Day fansite. I started making websites and
    solving Project Euler problems, and I got hooked. From there, I branched out into learning MySQL. I
    taught myself C (because, according to people in online forums, "real hackers program in C"). I tried
    Java and even spun a little Scheme when
    I tried to work through SICP. Most recently, I've been learning Python through Udacity's online courses,
    and I've studied Ruby because I want to try Rails.</p>

  <p>I'm fascinated and incredibly excited by all the innovations emerging from the tech world, and I
    aspire to work in the industry after I graduate. I'm working as hard as I can in all the spare time I
    have to try to catch up to the guys my age who've been hacking since they were 12. I'm constantly aware
    of the gaps in my knowledge and skills, but I'm striving to fill those gaps as well as I can.
    Zappos.Code() would be an invaluable opportunity for me.</p>
